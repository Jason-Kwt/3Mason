                We see ourselves as the masons for Web3.
                <br />
                <br />
                Web3 is the future we believe in.
                <br />
                Despite all disagreements, we are here standing up against
                doubts, guarding our future and building the utopia we believe
                in.

                The wolf on the top of the hill is never as hungry as the wolf
                climbing the hill.
                <br />
                We 3MASONS are a pack of starving wolves in the Web3 world -
                ambitious, enduring and steadfast, looking to claim our
                territory in the digital future.

                We are born to lead when others are in doubt, to create a path
                when hope is lost, and bring out the light when there is
                darkness.
                <br />
                <br />
                During this challenging time of Web3,
                <br />
                we keep our head low, maintain our composure and do what we
                should do.
                <br />
                <br />
                When the time comes... we will howl, take the plunge and fight
                for our land.
