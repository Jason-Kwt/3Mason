              We see ourselves as the masons for Web3.
              <br />
              <br />
              Web3 is the future we believe in.
              <br />
              Despite all disagreements, we are here standing up against doubts,
              guarding our future and building the utopia we believe in.

              The wolf on the top of the hill is never as hungry as the wolf
              climbing the hill.
              <br />
              We 3MASONS are a pack of starving wolves in the Web3 world -
              ambitious, enduring and steadfast, looking to claim our territory
              in the digital future.
              <br />

              {`We donâ€™t play in the circus.`}
              <br />
              We are born to lead when others are in doubt, to create a path
              when hope is lost, and bring out the light when there is darkness.
              <br />
              <br />
              During this challenging time of Web3,
              <br />
              we keep our head low, maintain our composure and do what we should
              do.
              <br />
              <br />
              When the time comes... we will howl, take the plunge and fight for
              our land.
